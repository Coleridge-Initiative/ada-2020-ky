# Applied Data Analytics - KY Summer/Fall 2020 Training Course
Repository for the Summer/Fall 2020 KY training program focused on Transitions in Education and Workforce, which was taught in SQL and R.

## Projects
Participants in this program were grouped into teams of 5 or fewer and created projects in hopes of understanding the labor market outcomes of individuals who acquired postsecondary degrees and credentials in Kentucky. Some project questions teams addressed were:

  - Do STEM degree earners from Kentucky institutions tend to leave the state for employment more often than other Kentucky graduates?
  - Are college students who earn a bachelor’s degree in education in Kentucky staying in Kentucky to teach, or are they often leaving to teach in another state?
  - What are common characteristics of STEM and health degree earners from Kentucky institutions that find employment in a bordering state?
  - How do the earning distributions and employment characteristics who earn their bachelor’s degree from a Kentucky university vary for those who have high-paying, stable employment patterns?
  - What is the relationship between the level of credential earned by program graduates in transportation, skilled trades, and manufacturing training programs and their earnings following graduation?
