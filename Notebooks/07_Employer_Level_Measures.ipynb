    "1. Different measures of stable employment\n",
    "1. Labor market interactions\n",

    "These two sections will have two different units of analysis: the first will focus directly on the individuals in our cohort while the second will focus on employers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start looking at their employers, a logical prelude would be taking a deeper dive into our cohort's employment. Here, we will walk through two different measures of stable employment within a cohort and see if their earnings differed significantly from those without stable employment. From there, we will load in our employer-level measures file and look at some characteristics we can use to get a better sense of Kentucky's labor market at the times of potential employment. In parallel with our cohort, the employer-level file contains information on all of Kentucky's employers in the UI wage records data from 2012Q4-2014Q3, the potential quarters of employment for our cohort when limiting earnings to one year post graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to discover any distinguishing factors between the overall labor market in Kentucky and the employers that hired members of our 2013 cohort. Ultimately, we want to gain a better understanding of the demand side when it comes to employment opportunities for our Kentucky graduates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Data Exploration notebook, we will pose a few direct questions we will use to answer our ultimate question: **How can we use labor market interactions to help explain employment outcomes of Kentucky graduates?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do so, we need to load our external R packages and connect to the database."
